Dubbed the "biggest girl group in the world", they are regarded as the most successful Korean girl group internationally and one of the leaders of the Korean Wave. They are stylistically associated with the "girl crush" concept in K-pop—exploring themes of self-confidence and female empowerment.</p>
                        <p> Promotions for the group's debut began in the first week of August 2016 with the release of teaser images, videos, and advertisements.
