                        </header><p> South Korean girl group Blackpink has performed in three concert tours (two of which have been worldwide), two one-day concerts and one fan meeting since their debut in August 2016. In July 2017, Blackpink held their debut Japanese showcase at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo in front of 14,000 fans. The group's first concert tour commenced in July 2018 with their Blackpink Arena Tour, which held 8 shows throughout Japan and attracted 125,000 spectators. In November of that year, Blackpink embarked on their first worldwide concert tour, titled "In Your Area" beginning in Seoul. The tour saw 36 shows in 17 countries across Asia, North America, Europe and Oceania. The tour garnered a record-breaking number of attendees and has been regarded as the most successful concert tour conducted by a K-pop girl group. From October 2022 to September 2023 Blackpink embarked on their Born Pink World Tour consisting of 66 concerts in 34 cities in 22 countries around the world. The tour attracted 1.8 million people, making it the most-attended concert tour by a K-pop girl group.  </p>

                            Blackpink held their first online virtual pay-per-view concert named "The Show" on January 31, 2021. It was available exclusively on Blackpink's YouTube channel and included first-time performances of songs from The Album, as well as a preview of member Rosé's "Gone" from her solo debut single R, which was later released on March 12. The livestream concert recorded approximately 280,000 paid subscribers, generating more than ₩10 billion (US$8.9 million) from ticket sales. </p>
